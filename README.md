# 🚀 DevOps Roadmap Projects

This repository contains projects I've built to improve my skills in DevOps, following the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/devops) learning path. To keep things organized and manage complexity, I have separated my work into different branches.

## 📂 Repository Structure & My Work

* **[`main` Branch](https://github.com/rumeysatr/Devops_Roadmap_Projects/tree/main):** The default branch you are currently on. It features my **Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions** project, where I put Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) concepts into practice.
* **[`Beginner-Projects` Branch](https://github.com/rumeysatr/Devops_Roadmap_Projects/tree/Beginner-Projects):** This branch contains my beginner-level projects and practices where I laid the foundations of my DevOps knowledge.

## 🛠️ Featured Project: CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The project in this main directory demonstrates the automated deployment process of a static website:
1. Whenever an update is pushed to the `index.html` file,
2. The workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is triggered,
3. The changes are automatically packaged and deployed live to GitHub Pages.
